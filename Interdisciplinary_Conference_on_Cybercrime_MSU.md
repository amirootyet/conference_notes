##### Speaker: Dr. Thomas Holt

- The left ideologies moving towards cyberattacks
- For a while, we noticed a decrease in physical attacks (and wondered if that was due to the Obama administration)
- However, there may be a cyber element to the decrease in physical attackers (maybe the attackers are now moving towards cyberattacks instead)
- ALF and Anonymous are two left groups
- Target is small or medium businesses
- Large organizations still see the bulk of the attacks
- example of an attack is the attack in support of Harambe by Anonymous
- Anonymous going after the Department of Agriculture
- Hudson Valley Foie Gras faces attacks by left ideologists
- We do not have a lot of detail about DDoS attacks
- Doxxing of the guy who won an auction to hunt a rhino 
  - Focus on making this person have a seizure by doxxing relevant medical information
- What came first for these attackers: hacking or ideologies?

> Were they hackers first who developed ideologies or were they ideologists who acquired hacking skills?

- How does recruitment for hacking happen in the left?
- Identify online behavioral patterns to recognize radical left or right (technically it is possible, legally, not really)
