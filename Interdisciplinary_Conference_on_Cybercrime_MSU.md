## [Interdisciplinary Conference on Cybercrime](https://cj.msu.edu/programs/interdisciplinary-conference-cybercrime/)

### The 6th Annual Michigan State University Interdisciplinary Conference on Cybercrime

#### April 15th and 16th, 2019 (8:30am â€“ 5pm)

#### Day 1

##### Speaker: Dr. Thomas Holt

- The left ideologies moving towards cyberattacks
- For a while, we noticed a decrease in physical attacks (and wondered if that was due to the Obama administration)
- However, there may be a cyber element to the decrease in physical attackers (maybe the attackers are now moving towards cyberattacks instead)
- ALF and Anonymous are two left groups
- Target is small or medium businesses
- Large organizations still see the bulk of the attacks
- example of an attack is the attack in support of Harambe by Anonymous
- Anonymous going after the Department of Agriculture
- Hudson Valley Foie Gras faces attacks by left ideologists
- We do not have a lot of detail about DDoS attacks
- Doxxing of the guy who won an auction to hunt a rhino 
  - Focus on making this person have a seizure by doxxing relevant medical information
- What came first for these attackers: hacking or ideologies?

> Were they hackers first who developed ideologies or were they ideologists who acquired hacking skills?

- How does recruitment for hacking happen in the left?
- Identify online behavioral patterns to recognize radical left or right (technically it is possible, legally, not really)

##### Speaker: Dr. Betty Cheng

- Autonomous mobility ecosystem
- In a few years, we will achieve level 4 or level 5 autonomy
- Is this exciting or scary?
- connected cars: communication between cars can become a security problem
- this communication is complex; there are many sensors, AI, training data

> Wired video of compromising a Jeep Cherokee video

> Link to study automobile vulnerabilities: [link](https://www.upstream.auto/)

- Number of attacks on automobiles have risen
1. Threat analysis
2. Develop a model targeting malicious actors
3. Criminological theory
- Prevention, detection, mitigation
- Concerns:
  1. Safety
  2. Information
  3. Stakeholders
  
- Threat:
  1. Interruption
  2. Interception
  3. Modification
  4. Fabrication
  
- 25 techniques of situational prevention
- SCP applied to cybersecurity
- Traditional security has lots of computation; cannot be done vehicle (wouldn't want to drive at 35 mph)
- Cars were built for safety, not cybersecurity

> While ABS braking, you cannot have your car thinking whether that's a trusted request

- OTA updates -> convenience versus safety

> We still don't have a lot of data to understand the range of vulnerabilities

- Automotive industry is competitive. How do OEMs, suppliers, and everyone work together?
- First steps:
  - Map the threat surface
  - How much knowledge do you need to attack?
  - Do you need physical access?
  - What kind of impact?
  
- Threat surfaces:
  - OBD2 port
  - Key fob
  - Media player
  - Dealer pass-through
  
> Key fob attacks are the only vehicle cyberattacks that we have seen in the wild

- The motivation for criminals to perform the key fob attack is immediate gratification (steal the vehicle)
- Security design patterns
- Security certification of autonomous systems

##### Mr. Nils Kessler

- Build logs into your system by law and an entity cannot say 'no' to law officers requesting logs
- Easier to do in countries such as China which is an authoritarian state

> We are going to do it or we will throw you out. On the other hand, we must convince a lot of people.

- These days organizations are observed saying "we're the privacy guys, we don't do it (provide logs to law enforcement)"
- The argument against providing backdoors is "if we install a backdoor, bad guys can access it too"
- San Bernardino iPhone case. 
- Motive: cause damage to computer system. Example: stance against animal cruelty
- Ransomware:
  1. Publish sensitive information
  2. Destroy critical information
  3. Deny access to the system
  
- Motive: DDoS attacks
- Motive: Data theft
- Theft of PII (Personally Identifiable information)
- Theft of IP (Intellectual Property)
  - Example: trade secret of steel manufacturing company

> Follow the money

- Example: wire transfer, trace the bank records
  - lot harder in the case of ransomware
  - no bread crumbs anymore
  - easier to cyberattack from outside of the United States
  - harder to get cooperation from foreign governments
  
- Carding schemes
- Fraud schemes:
  - romance scheme
  - investment scams
  - elderly fraud
    - elderly are mostly vulnerable because of the time they grew up in (more implicit trust)
    
- Sex-tortion (compromising material)
  - younger people are more vulnerable
  - younger people tend to overshare on social media
  
- Stalking and harassment
- Doxxing
- Book recommendation: `Midnight in Chernobyl`
- IoT security (Ring doorbell)

> Everything is integrated with the network

- Social engineering (not so technical)
  -example scenario: phone rings, number identified on phone as bank, doesn't jump right into asking for private info, you think it's legit, 5 minutes deep asks for PIN number, transfers a huge amount of money after hanging up.
  
> Not everything (that pops up) on your phone is authentic 

- Business email compromise (BEC)
  - example: vulnerability inside Outlook as installed straight out-of-the-box makes it easier to get inside.
  - scenario: email coming from supervisor asking to authorize wire transfer to a vendor. The vender is a shell company.
  - rules are set up such that the email alert never shows up.
  
- Introducing malware

> Security does not matter if somebody has already got a keylogger in

- Botnets: turn zombies to perform DDoS
- Hop point: basically, a proxy between your computer and the attacker's computer
- RAT (trojan)
